**Procedure**:
1. Place DUT in chamber, cable out to test equipment
2. Stabilize at temperature (2 hr minimum)
3. Run full ATP while at temperature
4. Monitor power consumption (should be within spec)
5. Visual inspection after test

**Data to Record**:

**Simplified Salt Fog Test** (if no chamber):
1. Prepare 5% NaCl solution (50g salt per liter)

| **Water Jet** | 6.3mm nozzle, 12.5 L/min, 3m | 3 min per face | No water inside |

**Simplified Water Test**:
1. Run unit (powered on)
2. Use garden hose with jet nozzle
3. Spray each face for 1 minute from 3m distance
4. Check for leaks, verify unit still operating
5. Open enclosure, check for water
